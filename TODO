* TO DO list

** Internode
   - [ ] Talk to them about when separate metered and unmetered will be
         completed in the .../usage/ part of the API.  Also ask about uploads.

** Add support for other ISPs
   - Will need help from people with accounts at other ISPs.


* Possible future plans?

** Add query support to list all configured ISPs
   - Want it to work similarly to network interfaces and free disk space
     currently works.

** Consider converting to PHP
   - Eliminate the need for separate binaries.
   - Remove some cross-platform headaches.
