Put get-isp-quota int <path_cacti>/scripts/

Copy ISP_Quota.conf to /etc/cacti, and change ownership and permissions so that
Cacti can read it, and no other user can.  Edit it to contain username and
password for the ISP accounts you want to monitor.

Click on Import Templates after opening Cacti in your web browser and select the
xml file.  IMPORTANT: Select "Use custom RRA settings from the template".  Click
on save to import the template.

Create a host and a graph in the usual way, supplying the index ID from the
ISP_Quota.conf file.
